# Biol-668-Python-OOP

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python to model biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Through a series of classes, the code replicates basic bioinformatics functionality such as sequence formatting, k-mer generation, codon translation, reverse complementation, and computation of protein propertiesâ€”all without using specialized libraries like Biopython.

# Project Structure
CHAN_OOP_FinalProject_2023.py
Core Python script implementing the class hierarchy:

Seq: Base class for generic sequences

DNA: Inherits from Seq and adds DNA-specific utilities

RNA: Inherits from DNA and adds transcription/translation logic

Protein: Inherits from Seq and calculates properties like hydrophobicity and molecular weight

CHAN_PythonProject_2025.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook showcasing usage examples and test cases for the implemented classes, with formatted output and explanatory cells.
